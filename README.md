# Gaming-Store-OOP-
üéØ Objective

The goal of this program is to build an interactive Game Shop System that allows users to:

Choose between different gaming consoles (Xbox or PlayStation).

Browse available games and their prices.

Select games to purchase.

Get a grand total of all selected games.

The system also includes exception handling (for invalid inputs) and demonstrates object-oriented programming principles.

üïπÔ∏è Overview of the Program

Our program simulates a small-scale game shop.
When the user starts:

They are prompted to enter their phone number.

They select which console they‚Äôd like to browse ‚Äî Xbox or PS4.

The program displays the list of games, their availability, and price.

The user chooses a game to buy, and the cost is added to the total.

The program then asks whether the user wants to continue shopping (Y/N).

The final grand total is displayed before exit.

If any exception occurs (like invalid input), the program gracefully terminates with an appropriate message.
